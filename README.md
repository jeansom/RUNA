* RUNGeneration contains a simple script to set your madgraph environment. 
* RUNSimulations generates MC samples from lhe files.
* RUNTriggerStudies performs validation and efficiency studies for triggers.
* RUNtuples creates Ntuples out of MiniAOD files, generated in RUNSimulations.
* RUAnalysis includes an example of how to use your Ntuples in your Analysis.
* RUNBTagScaleFactors and RUNMakeEfficiecyMaps contain scripts to calculate btag scale factors.

## Technical details

* RUNGeneration does not need to be inside CMSSW.
* To run madgraph in the RU hexfarm, just download the script inside RUNGeneration and follow the instructions in the README file.
* RUNSimulations creates samples according to RunIISpring15DR74 campaing.
* RUNtuples is a modified version of the [B2GNtuple](https://github.com/cmsb2g/B2GAnaFW/tree/master), using the 763 version of the jetToolbox.
* RUNAnalysis uses the ntuples created with this version of the RUNtuples.
